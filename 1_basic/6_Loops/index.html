        <h1>Loops</h1>
        <article>
            <h3>About</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Loops are precious tools for programmers as they gives us the ability to do a repetitive actions
                    for a group of elements by certain criteria.
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">'While', 'do while' </span> and <span class="bold"> 'for' </span>are useful when
                    want to execute code as
                    long as a certain criterion is true. Those loops can iterate through an array using its index.
                </li>
                <li>Iterate through an object with the<span class="bold"> 'for-in' </span>loop.</li>
                <li>Iterate through an array with <span class="bold">'foreach'</span> or with the <span class="bold">'map'</span>
                    methods. The map() method is designed to create a new array and to return it, while the forEach()
                    method returns the value of undefined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Skip or stop the iteration</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Break statement - </span> exit the loops mentioned in rows 2-3.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Continue statement - </span> skip to the next iteraton of the loops
                    mentioned in rows 2-3. </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Return statement - </span> acts as the continue statement in the forEach and map
                    methods.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Class practice</h3>
            <p>Data is available in the data.js file.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use the for loop to iterate through nameArr, create an ordered list with the names and append it to
                    the DOM.</li>
                <li>Use the while loop to iterate through nameArr, convert the values to uppercase and append them to the DOM as a
                    single 'p' element with the names seperated by commas. This paragraph should be displayed below
                    the list you have created in step 1.</li>
                <li>Use substring() to remove the last comma and add a period to the end of the paragraph.</li>
                <li>Use an alternative to loops to achieve a similar result as in stpes 2 + 3.</li>
                <li>Advanced: Use the while loop to iterate through the numArr, and execute one of the followig
                    statments, the most appropriate one:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the remainder of division by 4 is 0, log to the console the number with the
                            statment "The number is divisible by 4."</li>
                        <li>If the remainder of division by 3 is 0, and the remainder of division by 4 is
                            0, log to the console the number with the statment "The number is divisible
                            by 12."</li>
                        <li>If the remainder of division by 3 is 0, but the remainder of division by 4 is
                            greater than 0, skip to the next iteration."</li>
                        <li>If the remainder of division by 4 is 0, and the remainder of division by 50 is
                            0, break the loop."</li>
                    </ul>
            </ol>

                    <li>Random design:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create an index.html file with 300 'p' elements.</li>
                            <li>Create a style.css file with 10 classes, each one with unique style declerations.<br>If
                                you wish, you can get some insperation <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/"

                            <li>Create a random.js fle with a script that randomly adds a class to each of the exising
                                'p' elements.</li>
                            <li>Count how many times each class appears in the DOM. Create a list with the results and
                                add it to the top of your page.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Draw a chessboard on the page using JS loops.</li>
